# Hybrid-model-for-IDS
Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
Overview
This project follow out a Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that fuse Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Supervised Classification to enhance cybersecurity menace detection. 

Features
Anomaly Detection using:
Isolation Forest
One-Class SVM
Superintend Classification with:
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
Longsighted Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Feature Engineering techniques:
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Operation Evaluation including:
10-Fold Crabby-Validation
Hyperparameter Tuning
Disarray Matrix
ROC Curve Analysis
Explainable AI (XAI) Implementation (Upcoming):
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)

Installation
Ascertain you bear Python installed, and so establish the needed dependencies:
pip install -r requirements. txt
Usage
Run the main script to aim and judge the IDS model:
python ids2. py

Visualization plots for ROC curves and confusion intercellular substance will be saved
Future Improvements
Carrying Out of Explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP and LIME
Integration with real-time network traffic monitoring
Deployment as a cloud-based IDS solution
